Initial build ssytme for STM32 based microcontrollers.

The goal of it was to use readily available software without relying on the STMCubeMX IDE.

[STM32_Base_Project](https://github.com/rgujju/STM32_Base_Project/tree/master) was heavily used as a reference for getting the initial build system set up with CMAKE.

[Building for and debugging an ARM Cortex-M](https://blog.peramid.es/posts/2024-12-31-arm.html) was used as a reference for getting semihosting to work properly.
